# ThatOpen Navigation: OrthoPerspectiveCamera

## Overview

`OrthoPerspectiveCamera` extends `SimpleCamera` and provides three built-in
navigation modes (Orbit, FirstPerson, Plan) with switchable perspective and
orthographic projections. It wraps the `camera-controls` library and manages
dual Three.js cameras (`PerspectiveCamera` + `OrthographicCamera`).

**Package**: `@thatopen/components` (core — works in browser and Node.js)
**Dependency**: `camera-controls` >= 3.1.2

## Prerequisites

- World must be created with `OrthoPerspectiveCamera` as the camera type.
  See `thatopen-impl-viewer` for full viewer setup.
- `components.init()` MUST be called after camera assignment for the render
  loop to start.

```typescript
import * as OBC from "@thatopen/components";

const components = new OBC.Components();
const worlds = components.get(OBC.Worlds);
const world = worlds.create<
  OBC.SimpleScene,
  OBC.OrthoPerspectiveCamera,
  OBC.SimpleRenderer
>();

world.scene = new OBC.SimpleScene(components);
world.scene.setup();
world.renderer = new OBC.SimpleRenderer(components, container);
world.camera = new OBC.OrthoPerspectiveCamera(components);

components.init();
```

## Navigation Modes

Three built-in modes control how the user interacts with the 3D viewport.
Switch modes with `camera.set(mode)`.

### Mode Comparison Table

| Property          | Orbit               | FirstPerson          | Plan                 |
|-------------------|----------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| ID                | `"Orbit"`            | `"FirstPerson"`      | `"Plan"`             |
| Default           | Yes (active at start)| No                   | No                   |
| Rotation          | Full orbit around target | Look around from position | Disabled (locked)  |
| Pan               | Truck (right-drag)   | Truck (high speed)   | Truck (left-drag)    |
| Zoom              | Dolly (scroll)       | Dolly (scroll)       | Zoom (scroll)        |
| Projection        | Any                  | Perspective ONLY     | Any (ortho preferred)|
| Use case          | 3D model inspection  | Walkthroughs         | Floor plan views     |

### Orbit Mode (Default)

Standard 3D orbit navigation. Rotates around a target point.

**Camera-controls settings applied:**
- `minDistance`: 1
- `maxDistance`: 300
- `truckSpeed`: 2
- Orbit target calculated from camera direction and distance

```typescript
world.camera.set("Orbit");
```

### FirstPerson Mode

FPS-style navigation. Camera stays at a fixed position; user looks around
and moves through the scene.

**Camera-controls settings applied:**
- `minDistance`: 1, `maxDistance`: 1, `distance`: 1
- `truckSpeed`: 50
- Mouse wheel mapped to dolly action
- Two-finger touch mapped to zoom-truck

**CRITICAL**: FirstPerson mode ALWAYS requires perspective projection. It
CANNOT run with orthographic projection. ALWAYS validate before switching:

```typescript
const { current } = world.camera.projection;
if (current === "Orthographic") {
  // Switch to perspective first, or skip FirstPerson
  await world.camera.projection.set("Perspective");
}
world.camera.set("FirstPerson");
```

If you call `set("FirstPerson")` while in orthographic mode, the camera
falls back to Orbit mode instead.

### Plan Mode

2D floor plan navigation. Rotation is disabled; only pan and zoom work.
Ideal for architectural floor plans combined with clipping planes.

**Camera-controls settings applied:**
- Azimuth rotation speed: 0 (disabled)
- Polar rotation speed: 0 (disabled)
- Left mouse mapped to TRUCK (pan)
- Single-touch mapped to TOUCH_TRUCK
- Dual-touch mapped to TOUCH_ZOOM

When Plan mode is deactivated, original rotation speeds and mouse/touch
mappings are restored.

```typescript
// Switch to Plan mode for floor plan viewing
world.camera.set("Plan");

// Combine with orthographic projection for true floor plans
await world.camera.projection.set("Orthographic");
```

### Camera Controls Interaction Table

| Input               | Orbit           | FirstPerson     | Plan            |
|---------------------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------------|
| Left mouse drag     | Rotate          | Look around     | Pan             |
| Right mouse drag    | Pan (truck)     | Pan (truck)     | Pan (truck)     |
| Scroll wheel        | Zoom (dolly)    | Move (dolly)    | Zoom            |
| Single-finger touch | Rotate          | Look around     | Pan             |
| Two-finger touch    | Zoom + Pan      | Zoom + Truck    | Zoom            |

## Projection System

`ProjectionManager` handles switching between perspective and orthographic
cameras. Access it via `camera.projection`.

### Switching Projection

```typescript
// Set to orthographic
await world.camera.projection.set("Orthographic");

// Set to perspective
await world.camera.projection.set("Perspective");

// Toggle between the two
await world.camera.projection.toggle();

// Read current projection
const current: OBC.CameraProjection = world.camera.projection.current;
// Returns "Perspective" or "Orthographic"
```

### Projection Changed Event

Listen for projection changes to update UI or other components:

```typescript
world.camera.projection.onChanged.add(() => {
  const projection = world.camera.projection.current;
  console.log("Projection changed to:", projection);

  // Common pattern: toggle grid fade based on projection
  grid.fade = projection === "Perspective";
});
```

`onChanged` fires after the projection switch completes. The event emits
the new active `THREE.Camera` instance.

### Projection Compatibility Matrix

| Projection     | Orbit | FirstPerson | Plan  |
|----------------|-------|-------------|-------|
| Perspective    | Yes   | Yes         | Yes   |
| Orthographic   | Yes   | NO          | Yes   |

NEVER combine FirstPerson mode with Orthographic projection. ALWAYS
validate before allowing user selection of mode/projection combinations.

## Dual Camera Access

OrthoPerspectiveCamera maintains two Three.js camera instances:

```typescript
// Perspective camera (THREE.PerspectiveCamera)
const perspCam = world.camera.threePersp;

// Orthographic camera (THREE.OrthographicCamera)
const orthoCam = world.camera.threeOrtho;

// Active camera (whichever is current based on projection)
const activeCam = world.camera.three;
```

- `threePersp` and `threeOrtho` ALWAYS exist, regardless of current mode.
- `camera.three` returns whichever camera is currently active.
- The frustum size for orthographic projection is fixed at 50.
- Aspect ratio is automatically updated when the renderer resizes.

## Fit / Frame Objects

`fit()` positions the camera to frame a set of meshes in the viewport.

```typescript
// Fit specific meshes with default offset (1.5)
await world.camera.fit(meshes);

// Fit with custom offset (larger = more padding)
await world.camera.fit(meshes, 2.0);
```

**Parameters:**
- `meshes`: `Iterable<THREE.Mesh>` — the meshes to frame
- `offset`: `number` (default `1.5`) — padding multiplier around the
  bounding box. Values > 1 add space around the objects.

There is also a convenience method `fitToItems()` that fits to all loaded
fragment models:

```typescript
// Frame all loaded models
world.camera.fitToItems();
```

## User Input Control

Temporarily disable or enable all camera controls:

```typescript
// Disable all user camera input
world.camera.setUserInput(false);

// Re-enable user camera input
world.camera.setUserInput(true);
```

When disabled, `setUserInput(false)` stores the current mouse button
mappings and then nullifies them. When re-enabled, mappings are restored.

Use this to lock the camera during animations, automated camera movements,
or guided tours.

## Custom Navigation Modes

Register a custom navigation mode that follows the `NavigationMode`
interface:

```typescript
interface NavigationMode {
  id: string;        // Unique mode identifier
  enabled: boolean;  // Whether this mode is currently active
  set(active: boolean): void;  // Called when mode is activated/deactivated
}
```

Register and use:

```typescript
const flyMode: OBC.NavigationMode = {
  id: "Fly",
  enabled: false,
  set(active: boolean) {
    this.enabled = active;
    if (active) {
      // Configure camera-controls for fly behavior
      const controls = world.camera.controls;
      controls.minDistance = 0;
      controls.maxDistance = Infinity;
      controls.truckSpeed = 10;
    }
  },
};

world.camera.addCustomNavigationMode(flyMode);
world.camera.set("Fly");
```

Custom modes are stored in the internal `_navigationModes` map alongside
the built-in Orbit, FirstPerson, and Plan modes.

## Camera Controls (Low-Level)

Direct access to the underlying `camera-controls` instance:

```typescript
const controls = world.camera.controls;

// Set camera position and look-at target
await controls.setLookAt(x, y, z, targetX, targetY, targetZ);

// Smooth transition
await controls.setLookAt(x, y, z, tx, ty, tz, true); // animated

// Listen for camera updates (e.g., to update fragment LOD)
controls.addEventListener("update", () => {
  fragments.core.update();
});
```

ALWAYS use `controls.setLookAt()` for programmatic camera positioning.
NEVER set `camera.three.position` directly — camera-controls will
overwrite it on the next frame.

## Floor Plan Setup Pattern

Complete pattern for floor plan viewing with Plan mode:

```typescript
// 1. Switch to Plan mode (disables rotation)
world.camera.set("Plan");

// 2. Switch to orthographic projection
await world.camera.projection.set("Orthographic");

// 3. Position camera looking straight down
await world.camera.controls.setLookAt(
  centerX, height, centerZ,  // camera position (above the floor)
  centerX, 0, centerZ,       // look-at target (floor level)
);

// 4. Disable grid fade for orthographic
grid.fade = false;

// 5. Add clipping plane at floor level (see thatopen-impl-clipping-plans)
// const clipper = components.get(OBC.Clipper);
// clipper.createFromNormalAndCoplanarPoint(world, normal, point);
```

## Critical Rules

1. **NEVER** combine FirstPerson mode with Orthographic projection. The
   camera silently falls back to Orbit mode, causing confusing behavior.
2. **ALWAYS** validate mode/projection compatibility before switching.
3. **NEVER** set `camera.three.position` directly. ALWAYS use
   `camera.controls.setLookAt()` or `camera.controls.moveTo()`.
4. **ALWAYS** call `projection.set()` with `await` — it returns a Promise.
5. **NEVER** forget to listen to `projection.onChanged` when your UI or
   components depend on the current projection type.
6. **ALWAYS** use `setUserInput(false)` during programmatic camera
   animations to prevent user interference.
7. **ALWAYS** call `camera.dispose()` on cleanup (handled automatically
   when the world is disposed via `worlds.delete(world)`).
8. **NEVER** instantiate OrthoPerspectiveCamera with `new` and forget to
   assign it to `world.camera`. The camera needs a world context.
