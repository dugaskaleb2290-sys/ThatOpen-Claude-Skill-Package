# ThatOpen Measurements

## Overview

This skill covers the measurement system in `@thatopen/components-front`:
LengthMeasurement, AreaMeasurement, VolumeMeasurement, and AngleMeasurement.
All four extend the abstract `Measurement<T, U>` base class, which provides
shared visual elements, snapping, units, disposal, and event handling.

**Version**: @thatopen/components-front 3.3.x
**Prerequisites**: thatopen-impl-viewer (world setup), thatopen-core-architecture

## Measurement Type Comparison

| Type | Class | Modes | Unit Type | Visual Elements |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| Distance | `LengthMeasurement` | `"free"`, `"edge"` | mm, cm, m, km | DimensionLine + Mark labels |
| Area | `AreaMeasurement` | `"free"`, `"square"`, `"face"` | mm2, cm2, m2, km2 | MeasureFill + DimensionLine + Mark |
| Volume | `VolumeMeasurement` | `"free"` | mm3, cm3, m3, km3 | MeasureVolume + DimensionLine + Mark |
| Angle | `AngleMeasurement` | `"free"` | deg, rad | Arc geometry + DimensionLine + Mark |

## Measurement Base Class

All measurement classes extend:

```typescript
abstract class Measurement<
  T extends Record<string, any>,
  U extends keyof MeasureToUnitMap
> extends OBC.Component implements OBC.Createable, OBC.Hideable, OBC.Disposable
```

### Shared Data Collections

| Collection | Type | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `list` | `DataSet<T>` | All measurement elements of that type |
| `lines` | `DataSet<DimensionLine>` | Visual dimension lines |
| `fills` | `DataSet<MeasureFill>` | Visual area fill meshes |
| `labels` | `DataSet<Mark>` | HTML label overlays |
| `volumes` | `DataSet<MeasureVolume>` | Visual volume meshes |

### Shared Configuration Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `enabled` | `boolean` | `false` | Activates measurement interaction |
| `visible` | `boolean` | `true` | Shows/hides all visual elements |
| `units` | `MeasureToUnitMap[U]` | per type | Unit for display |
| `rounding` | `number` | `2` | Decimal precision |
| `color` | `THREE.Color` | blue | Color of all visual elements |
| `delay` | `number` | `300` | Pointer stop detection delay (ms) |
| `world` | `OBC.World` | — | World reference (REQUIRED) |

### Material Properties

| Property | Type | Default |
|---|---|---|
| `linesMaterial` | `THREE.LineBasicMaterial` | Blue, depthTest false |
| `fillsMaterial` | `THREE.MeshLambertMaterial` | Green, double-sided, 30% opacity |
| `volumesMaterial` | `THREE.MeshLambertMaterial` | Green, double-sided, 30% opacity |
| `linesEndpointElement` | `HTMLElement` | Blue rounded div (dimension mark) |

### Static Members

```typescript
// Custom value formatter — applies to ALL measurement instances
Measurement.valueFormatter = (value: number) => `${value.toFixed(1)} m`;
```

ALWAYS set `Measurement.valueFormatter` before enabling measurements if you
need custom label formatting. It is a static property shared across all
measurement types.

### Events

| Event | Payload | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `onPointerStop` | — | Pointer stopped moving for `delay` ms |
| `onPointerMove` | — | Pointer moved |
| `onStateChanged` | `MeasurementStateChange[]` | Mode, color, units, rounding, visibility, or enabled changed |
| `onEnabledChange` | `boolean` | Enabled toggled |
| `onVisibilityChange` | `boolean` | Visibility toggled |
| `onDisposed` | — | Measurement disposed |

### MeasurementStateChange Values

```typescript
type MeasurementStateChange =
  | "mode" | "color" | "units" | "rounding" | "visibility" | "enabled";
```

### Unit Types

```typescript
type MeasureToUnitMap = {
  length: "mm" | "cm" | "m" | "km";
  area: "mm2" | "cm2" | "m2" | "km2";
  volume: "mm3" | "cm3" | "m3" | "km3";
  angle: "deg" | "rad";
};
```

Default units: length = `"m"`, area = `"m2"`, volume = `"m3"`, angle = `"deg"`.

## Snapping System

Snapping is provided by the `GraphicVertexPicker` inside the base class.
Configure snapping via these properties on any measurement instance:

| Property | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `snappings` | Snapping class array | Which snap types to use: `LINE`, `POINT`, `FACE` |
| `snapDistance` | `number` | Maximum distance for snapping (world units) |
| `pickerSize` | `number` | Visual size of the snap marker (pixels, default 6) |
| `pickerMode` | `GraphicVertexPickerMode` | `DEFAULT` (with snapping) or `SYNCHRONOUS` |

### Snapping Classes

| Class | Visual Indicator | Snap Behavior |
|---|---|---|
| `LINE` | Gray border, square | Snaps to nearest edge |
| `POINT` | Red border, square | Snaps to nearest vertex |
| `FACE` | Purple border, circle | Snaps to face surface |

ALWAYS configure `snappings` before enabling measurements. The default
snapping array includes LINE, POINT, and FACE.

## Measurement Lifecycle

All measurement types follow the same creation lifecycle via the
`Createable` interface:

```
1. Set enabled = true        → activates vertex picker and pointer events
2. User clicks → create()    → places first point / adds point
3. User clicks → create()    → places additional points (area/volume/angle)
4. endCreation()             → finalizes measurement, adds to list
5. cancelCreation()          → discards in-progress measurement
6. delete()                  → removes measurement under cursor via raycasting
7. Set enabled = false       → deactivates interaction
```

- `create()` is called on each click. For LengthMeasurement it takes two
  clicks (start + end). For AreaMeasurement it takes 3+ clicks. For
  AngleMeasurement it takes exactly 3 clicks. For VolumeMeasurement,
  points define the volume boundary.
- `endCreation()` finalizes the current measurement. For AreaMeasurement,
  a minimum of 3 points is required.
- `cancelCreation()` discards any in-progress measurement without saving.
- `delete()` uses raycasting against measurement bounding boxes to find
  and remove the measurement under the cursor.

## LengthMeasurement

Measures distance between two points. Supports free placement and edge
snapping.

```typescript
import * as OBCF from "@thatopen/components-front";

const lengths = components.get(OBCF.LengthMeasurement);
lengths.world = world;
lengths.enabled = true;
lengths.mode = "free"; // or "edge"
```

**UUID**: `"2f9bcacf-18a9-4be6-a293-e898eae64ea1"`

### Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `"free"` | Click any two points to measure distance between them |
| `"edge"` | Snap to geometry edges; measures edge length |

### Workflow

1. Set `enabled = true` and `mode`
2. User clicks first point → `create()` initializes preview line
3. Preview line follows cursor with snapping
4. User clicks second point → `create()` → `endCreation()` finalizes
5. DimensionLine with label appears showing the distance

## AreaMeasurement

Measures area defined by a polygon of 3+ points.

```typescript
const areas = components.get(OBCF.AreaMeasurement);
areas.world = world;
areas.enabled = true;
areas.mode = "free"; // or "square" or "face"
```

**UUID**: `"09b78c1f-0ff1-4630-a818-ceda3d878c75"`

### Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `"free"` | Click 3+ points to define a polygon area |
| `"square"` | Click 2 points to define a rectangular area |
| `"face"` | Click a face to measure its area directly |

### Extra Properties

| Property | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `pickTolerance` | `number` | `0.1` | Precision for point selection |
| `tolerance` | `number` | `0.005` | Margin for point inclusion in area |

### Workflow

1. Set `enabled = true` and `mode`
2. User clicks points → `create()` adds each point
3. Preview fill updates showing the polygon
4. Call `endCreation()` when polygon is complete (min 3 points)
5. MeasureFill with perimeter DimensionLines and label appears

## VolumeMeasurement

Measures volume defined by a 3D boundary.

```typescript
const volumes = components.get(OBCF.VolumeMeasurement);
volumes.world = world;
volumes.enabled = true;
volumes.mode = "free";
```

**UUID**: `"01f885ab-ec4e-4e6c-a853-9dfc0d6766ed"`

### Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `"free"` | Define volume boundary by selecting geometry faces |

### Extra Events

| Event | Payload | Trigger |
|---|---|---|
| `onPreviewInitialized` | `MeasureVolume` | Preview volume object created |

### Workflow

1. Set `enabled = true`
2. `initPreview()` creates a MeasureVolume preview (fires `onPreviewInitialized`)
3. User clicks faces → `create()` adds selected items to preview
4. `endCreation()` clones preview volume into `list`
5. `cancelCreation()` disposes preview without saving

## AngleMeasurement

Measures the angle between three points (vertex at second point).

```typescript
const angles = components.get(OBCF.AngleMeasurement);
angles.world = world;
angles.enabled = true;
angles.mode = "free";
```

**UUID**: `"2c88a142-2378-422e-b26a-bb2710841813"`

### Modes

| Mode | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `"free"` | Click three points to measure the angle at the middle point |

### Constants

| Constant | Value | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ARC_SEGMENTS` | `32` | Number of segments in the arc visualization |
| `ARC_RADIUS_FACTOR` | `0.3` | Arc radius relative to shortest arm |
| `LABEL_OFFSET_FACTOR` | `1.4` | Label distance from arc center |

### Workflow

1. Set `enabled = true`
2. User clicks first point → `create()` (click 1)
3. User clicks second point (vertex) → `create()` (click 2)
4. User clicks third point → `create()` (click 3) → `endCreation()`
5. Arc visualization with angle label appears

## Setup Pattern (All Types)

ALWAYS follow this pattern when setting up any measurement type:

```typescript
import * as OBC from "@thatopen/components";
import * as OBCF from "@thatopen/components-front";

// 1. Get the measurement component
const lengths = components.get(OBCF.LengthMeasurement);

// 2. Assign world (REQUIRED before enabling)
lengths.world = world;

// 3. Configure snapping (optional — defaults include LINE, POINT, FACE)
lengths.snapDistance = 0.5;
lengths.pickerSize = 8;

// 4. Configure units and rounding (optional)
lengths.units = "m";
lengths.rounding = 2;

// 5. Configure color (optional)
lengths.color = new THREE.Color(0xff0000);

// 6. Set mode
lengths.mode = "free";

// 7. Enable (ALWAYS last — this activates pointer events)
lengths.enabled = true;
```

NEVER enable a measurement before assigning `world`. The vertex picker
requires a valid world reference to perform raycasting.

## Toggling Between Measurement Types

ALWAYS disable the current measurement before enabling another:

```typescript
// Switch from length to area
lengths.enabled = false;
areas.enabled = true;
```

NEVER have multiple measurement types enabled simultaneously. They share
pointer events and will conflict.

## Deleting Measurements

```typescript
// Delete measurement under cursor (interactive)
lengths.delete();

// Delete all measurements of a type
lengths.list.clear(); // Clears all length measurements
```

## Disposal

ALWAYS dispose measurement components when no longer needed:

```typescript
// Dispose a specific measurement type
lengths.dispose();

// Or let components.dispose() handle all cleanup
components.dispose();
```

`dispose()` clears the vertex picker, all DataSets (list, lines, fills,
labels, volumes), and disposes all materials. NEVER use a measurement
instance after calling `dispose()`.

## Clipping Plane Integration

Measurements support clipping plane visibility:

```typescript
lengths.applyPlanesVisibility(planes);
```

This updates all visual elements (lines, fills, volumes) to respect the
provided clipping planes.

## Critical Rules

1. **ALWAYS** assign `world` before setting `enabled = true`.
2. **ALWAYS** disable one measurement type before enabling another.
3. **ALWAYS** call `dispose()` or `components.dispose()` on cleanup.
4. **ALWAYS** call `endCreation()` to finalize a measurement. Without it,
   the measurement stays in preview state.
5. **ALWAYS** call `cancelCreation()` to discard an in-progress measurement
   cleanly. Do not just disable — this leaks preview elements.
6. **NEVER** enable multiple measurement types simultaneously.
7. **NEVER** use measurement instances after `dispose()`.
8. **NEVER** forget to set `mode` before enabling — the default mode may
   not match the desired interaction.
9. **NEVER** set `Measurement.valueFormatter` after measurements are
   already created — existing labels will not update retroactively.
10. **NEVER** skip snapping configuration when precision matters — default
    snap distance may be too large or too small for your model scale.
