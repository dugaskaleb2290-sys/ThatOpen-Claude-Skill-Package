## What is this?

A collection of **18 deterministic skills** that give Claude Code deep knowledge of the ThatOpen BIM engine ecosystem. Each skill contains verified API patterns, working code examples, and documented anti-patterns — all sourced from the official ThatOpen repositories.

## Installation

Add these skills to your Claude Code project:

```bash
# Clone into your project's .claude/skills/ directory
git clone https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/ThatOpen-Claude-Skill-Package.git .claude/skills/thatopen
```

Or add as a git submodule:

```bash
git submodule add https://github.com/OpenAEC-Foundation/ThatOpen-Claude-Skill-Package.git .claude/skills/thatopen
```

## Skill Structure

Each skill follows a consistent structure:

```
skills/source/thatopen-{category}/thatopen-{category}-{topic}/
  SKILL.md              # Main skill file (<500 lines)
  references/
    methods.md          # Complete API signatures
    examples.md         # Working code examples
    anti-patterns.md    # What NOT to do (with fixes)
```

## Quality Guarantees

- **Source-verified**: All API patterns traced to official ThatOpen repositories
- **Deterministic language**: ALWAYS/NEVER rules, not vague suggestions
- **Version-pinned**: Targets specific package versions with migration notes
- **Error-aware**: Every skill includes failure modes and recovery patterns
- **Copy-pasteable examples**: Complete, runnable code with imports
